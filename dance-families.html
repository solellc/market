  <h1>Welcome Dance Families!</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, we are Jay and Leslie Hayes!
    We are reaching out to offer flowers (we affectionately call our “bundles”) for you this recital season.
    We know from experience how hectic things can get for dance families on recital day.
    That is why we want to offer this service.
    It will greatly improve the quality experience of your recital day.
    Everyone wants to give their special dancer the gift of flowers after a great performance.
    Wouldn’t it be wonderful to have them brought to you instead of having to add another stop to your already busy day?
  </p>

  <p>
    Here’s what we’re offering… We would provide a simple form for you to reserve your bundle(s) ahead of time.
    Each bundle comes with a keepsake custom tag and a charm.
    On the form, you can select your bundle’s name, e.g. “Bundle of Love”.
    You can also provide a custom message that will be printed on the tag to give to your dancer.
    We offer two different sizes: “demi” &amp; regular.
    Bundles are fresh cut flowers and will be pre-wrapped with flower food.
    Style, color, and arrangement will vary.
  </p>

        <dd>Perfect size to make a big impression!</dd>
      </dl>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We hope this will enhance the entire recital experience for your family!
    On recital day, we will be set up at a small table for you to pick up your bundle and enjoy.
    We would be honored to add this touch of beauty and simplicity to a day that you’ve worked so hard for all year.
    Hope you have had a great dance season.
    Can’t wait to see you on stage!
  </p>
