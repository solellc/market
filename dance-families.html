  <h1>Dance Families</h1>

  <p>
    We know from experience how hectic things can get for you on recital day.
    That is why we want to offer this service.
    Your dancer is special, and they deserve the gift of flowers after a great performance.
    Wouldn’t it be great to have them brought to you instead of having to add another stop to your already busy day?
  </p>

  <p>
  Each bundle comes with a <strong>keepsake custom tag and a charm</strong>.
    You are able to select your bundle’s name, e.g. “Bundle of Love”.
    You are also able to provide a custom message that will be printed on the tag to give your dancer.
    We offer two different sizes.
    Our “demi” is sized perfectly for a small dancer’s hands at approximately <strong>10-12” tall and is $10</strong>.
    Our “regular” is sized at <strong>16-20” and is $20</strong>.
    Bundles are fresh cut flowers and will be pre-wrapped with flower food.
    Style, color, and arrangement will vary (examples below).
